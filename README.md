# Zhian N. Kamvar

I am a recovering bioinformatician and Research Software Engineer, responsible for developing
[The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/). 

I have been developing R packages in the realms of population genetics, epidemiology, reproducible research, and publication since 2012. 
I enjoy cats 🐈‍⬛, baking 🥖, mushroom hunting 🍄, bad horror movies 👻, and good speculative fiction 📚.  

**I am on sabbatical and will be looking for work starting March 2024**

Some of my projects include:

- [{sandpaper}](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper): lesson engine for The Carpentries Workbench
- [{tinkr}](https://docs.ropensci.org/tinkr) (with Maëlle Salmon): conversion from Markdown to XML and back again
- [{poppr}](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr): population genetics toolkit for clonal and/or sexual populations
- [{aweek}](https://repidemicsconsortium.org/aweek): conversion from datetimes to weeks starting on any day of the week
