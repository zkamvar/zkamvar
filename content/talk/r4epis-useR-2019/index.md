Data analysis is integral to informing operational elements of humanitarian
medical responses. Field epidemiologists play a central role in informing such
responses as they aim to rapidly collect, analyse and disseminate results to
support Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and partners with timely and targeted
intervention strategies. However, a lack of standardised analytical methods
within MSF challenges this process. The R4epis project group consists of 18
professionals with expertise in: R programming, field epidemiology, data
science, health information systems, geographic information systems, and public
health. Between October 2018 and April 2019, R scripts were developed to
address all aspects of data cleaning, data analysis, and automatic reporting
for outbreaks (measles, meningitis, cholera and acute jaundice) and surveys
(retrospective mortality, malnutrition and vaccination coverage). Analyses and
outputs were piloted and validated by epidemiologists using historical data.
The resulting templates were made available to field epidemiologists for field
testing, which was conducted between February and April 2019. R4epis will
contribute to the improvement of the quality, timeliness, consistency of data
analyses and standardisation of outputs from field epidemiologists during
emergency response.
