Since the end of 2018, I've been a part of a collaboration between [RECON] and
[MSF] called the [R4EPIs initiative] where we are trying to integrate a more
standardized workflow of R for field epidemiologists so that it can be more
cost-effective (no license fees) and troubleshooting among epidemiologists can
be more effective. We have a repository to host templates for automated 
situation reports at <https://github.com/R4EPI/sitrep>. When we created the 
GitHub organisation, we wanted to make sure that the code being submitted to the
repository was genuinely authored by the person and didn't contain malware from
a hijacked account[^1], so we [required 2-factor authentication] for the R4EPI
github organisation from the start.

### Use the SSH protocol with GitHub if you use 2FA

If things went smoothly, I wouldn't be writing a blog post about this. The main
hiccup here was not the 2-factor authentication part. Apps like [Google
Authenticator] or [Authy] make it really easy to set this up by allowing you to
download an app and scan a QR code with your phone camera to set it up. The
roadblocks came from using git on the command line. 

When users set up git on their computer, GitHub recommends that they [use the
https protocol] for various reasons, but partially because this is the easiest
to set up. The problem is that if you have 2-factor authentication set up, even
if you have a [credential helper] to cache your password, that's only one part
of the 2-factor authentication. You will still need to authenticate yourself
every single time you pull and push, which causes issues like this:

To solve this, we told our members to [use the ssh protocol]. This is a bit more
involved because the user has to interact with the command line, but there are
several good walkthroughs, including the extremely helpful [happy git with R by
Jenny Bryan]. When you have an SSH key, you are telling GitHub that you trust
that particular machine and don't need any secondary authentication if code is
coming from there. One of the things I like about SSH keys is the fact that you
can remove them from GitHub if your laptop gets stolen/repurposed.

Of course, if your repositories were already cloned using the https method, then
you need to change the remote URL to use SSH. Copy and paste this code to change
an https remote to SSH (assuming that you only need to change the origin remote):

```sh
git remote get-url origin \
| sed 's_https://github.com/_git@github.com:_' \
| xargs git remote set-url origin
```

If you don't use git on the command line, you can still do this within R using
the git2r package:

```r
myurl <- git2r::remote_url(remote = "origin")
newurl <- sub("https://github.com/", "git@github.com:", myurl)
git2r::remote_set_url(name = "origin", url = newurl)
```

### Make sure you have your backups

When I started using 2fa, I used both an authenticator app and a phone number.
This worked great until the day that I tried to replace the battery on my phone
and ended up damaging the screen. It's no surprise that my 2fa no longer worked
for me when I couldn't access the only place I had the secondary authentication.
Nowadays, I have a [YubiKey] on my keychain, one at home, and a set of recovery
codes in a safe place in case I ever lose my phone.
