**content warning** I discuss death in this post

A year ago, I had a living mother, I had a living cat, and I had a job. Right
now, I only have a job, and in one month, it will cease to exist. I will be
left---as I have found my self so many times this year---facing a vacuum in the
shape of something so familiar, and picking up the pieces of my life that were
destroyed when that vacuum collapses.

I am tired and I am burnt out.

## The Year that Swallowed Everything

It's March, two days before my 17-year-old cat's birthday and he no longer is
eating. We put him to sleep the next day.

It's mid-April, I start a coordinated effort to smoothly transition more than 50
lesson repositories to use [a project I had poured all of my energy into](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). This transition directly affects
over a hundred volunteers and indirectly, thousands. I push myself because I
know that I am proud of what I can accomplish.

It's mid-May, I reached a major milestone of transitioning all of the official
lessons. The same morning I finish the last lesson, I was informed by email that
[there was no longer funding to retain my position through to
2024](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/06/lesson-infrastructure-updates/). I am
now responsible for maintaining the project through December, 
heavily documenting the maintenance workflow, and training three of my 
colleagues in R package development and maintenance.

It's mid-June, after a company retreat to discuss a future I could not be a part
of, I get COVID.

It's July, I get a call from the emergency room. My mother had a stroke and has
aphasia. I make an emergency flight down. She recovers well.

It's mid-September, I have a really good third-round interview for a job that
fits well with my experience. A few days later, I find out that the job went to
a friend of mine (who absolutely deserves it). I am happy for him, but it is 
nevertheless bittersweet.

It's September 27th at 9:43 in the morning. [I announced on Mastodon that I was in
search of a new job](https://hachyderm.io/@zkamvar/111138113844085010). I feel
good about this. It was a post thread like this that landed me my current
position, which I've had for almost 4 years. A few minutes later, I get a call
from the emergency room. By the afternoon, [I find that my life is going to
change once again](https://hachyderm.io/@zkamvar/111139381770150122). 

I was thrust into a new role as the primary caregiver for my mother while she
started her path to the end of life in hospice care. This was a role that came
with tears, sleepless nights, gratitude for small comforts, and utter disdain
for the inhumanity of human resources when negotiating FMLA. On October 27th, [I
paid a small tribute to the person who raised
me](https://hachyderm.io/@zkamvar/111308348150903834)---my own mother, whom I
would never see again. This was a time of weeping. There was no 

It's mid-November. My partner and I are driving down OR-99W so that I can bring
my mother to her final place of rest. The morning is cold as the sun breaks
through the gentle fog that has settled over the forest to create a stunning
_komorebi_ (木漏れ日) as we walk back to the car, my bag lighter than it was 
when we entered.

It is the end of November. An email is sent notifying the staff that 6 more of
us were to be laid off at the end of the year. I have no words.

## Sabbatical

Sometime in November, I realised that I am not going to have a job at the
beginning of the year, but I also understood that this is time for me to take a
purposeful step back and focus on my health. With everything that has happened
this year, I know that I need a sabbatical.
