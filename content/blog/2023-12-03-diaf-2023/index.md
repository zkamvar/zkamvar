**content warning** I discuss death in this post

A year ago, I had a living mother, I had a living cat, and I had a job. Right
now, I only have a job, and in one month, it will cease to exist. I will be
left---as I have found my self so many times this year---facing a vacuum in the
shape of something so familiar; picking up the pieces of my life that were
destroyed when that vacuum collapses.

It's March, two days before my 17-year-old cat's birthday and he no longer is
eating. We put him to sleep the next day.

It's mid-May, I reached a major milestone for [a project I had poured all of my
energy into](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). I was informed by email
that [there was no longer funding to retain my position through to
2024](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/06/lesson-infrastructure-updates/). I
am told that I need to train the people who will be taking over my work. 

It's mid-June, after a company retreat to discuss a future I could not be a part
of, I get COVID.

It's July, I get a call from the emergency room. My mother had a stroke and has
aphasia. I make an emergency flight down.

It's mid-September, I have a really good third-round interview for a job that
fits well with my experience. A few days later, I find out that the job went to
a friend of mine (who absolutely deserves it).

It's September 27th at 9:43 in the morning. [I announced on Mastodon that I was in
search of a new job](https://hachyderm.io/@zkamvar/111138113844085010). I feel
good about this. It was a post thread like this that landed me my current
position, which I've had for almost 4 years. A few minutes later, I get a call
from the emergency room. By the afternoon, [I find that my life is going to
change once again](https://hachyderm.io/@zkamvar/111139381770150122). 

I was thrust into a new role as the primary caregiver for my mother while she
started her path to the end of life in hospice care. This was a role that came
with tears, sleepless nights, gratitude for small comforts, and utter disdain
for the inhumanity of human resources when negotiating FMLA. On October 27th, [I
paid a small tribute to the person who raised
me](https://hachyderm.io/@zkamvar/111308348150903834), a person whom I would
never see again. This was a time of weeping.

It's mid-November. I am driving down OR-99W so that I can bring my mother to her
final place of rest. The morning is cold as the sun breaks through the gentle
fog that has settled over the old growth to create a stunning _komorebi_ 
(木漏れ日) as we walk back to the car, my bag lighter than it was when we 
entered.
