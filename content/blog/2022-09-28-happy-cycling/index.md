If you asked me five years ago in Lincoln, Nebraska what I would be doing in
five years, I would not have been able to give you a good answer beyond either
postdoc or R developer. At that time, I was learning Docker and continuous 
integration for reproducible research. In the life of an academic, five years
might as well be a century. Technologies change, grant cycles end, and new
projects are always on the horizon. Unless you are a professor or grad students,
few will stay in the same place for five years. This blog post will not
necessarily answer the question of where will I be in 2027, but it will help me
understand my journey for professional development in those five years.

On 2022-12-11, I will have been with The Carpentries for 1000 days, which is one
quarter shy of three years. Aside from my Ph.D. work (and yes, [graduate work
is work](https://www.cge6069.org/)), this is the longest I have ever stayed in
any one job---ever (which says more about the academic system than about me).
Before coming to work for a global non-profit, I was working as a postdoc
researcher in the Department of Plant Pathology at University Nebraska-Lincoln
and then as a postdoc researcher/[Research Software Engineer
(RSE)](https://researchsoftware.org/) at the Department of Infectious Disease
Epidemiology at Imperial College London. In both of these positions, I was
strictly a temporary employee and was paid (roughly) \$50,000 per year[^1].

[^1]: UNL paid \$47,500, but had a low cost of living whereas ICL paid
    \~\$50,000 after conversion to USD and was based in London, UK.... so you
    can guess which place I was actually able to *save* money.

When I joined The Carpentries, I was offered \$100,000 per year on an 18 month
contract to help redesign the lesson infrastructure [^2]. And after 18
months from the initial start date, I had a [working prototype of the lesson
infrastructure][sandpaper-renv] that would eventually become known as [The
Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. And now, just over a year later, we are
preparing to enter the [Beta Phase of The Carpentries Workbench][blog-beta],
which will give us a sense of how well the workbench actually works in a
broader, and less controlled context than [The Alpha Testing][alpha]. Once the
Beta Phase is complete in Q1 of 2023, we will start off Q2 by converting all of
the lessons to use The Workbench, and my work, after three years will be
complete.

Wait, what?

Of course my work will not be complete when we roll out the workbench for all of
our lessons; that's just the beginning! There is still plenty of room for The
Workbench to grow once it is released---that's what I designed it for! But, just
like I spend _maybe_ a few hours per quarter on my packages from Grad School
nowadays, the infrastructure will reach a state of equilibrium where development
s less of a day-to-day task and more of a weekly or monthly task. While I was
hired to design, build, and maintain this infrastructure, I also need to find
room to grow in my position.

In July 2022, my supervisor, François Michonneau [took a new job at Voltron
Data after 4+ years at The Carpentries][cry]. In a small company like
The Carpentries, one person leaving has a big impact. In no small part, he was
responsible for the development of The Workbench by not only providing
experience and guidance of how lessons were developed and hosted, but also by
advocating for protection of my time for deep thinking and continued support
when I was in a state of self-sabotage. His departure has forced me to think
about my career in a broader scope. At the moment, I am at a comfortable place
in my career: I do what I love, I get paid well for it, I work with really great
people, and I work for a company that does public benefit work where day to day
operations actually reflect its core values. But what happens when something
changes? What if, someday, I leave The Carpentries[^3]? How do I best prepare
myself for such a change (regardless of whether it is voluntary or involuntary)
and how to I make sure that the wake I leave behind causes no more than a gentle
rocking of my colleagues' proverbial canoes?

Recently, my new supervisor (Kari L. Jordan) suggested that I start thinking
about my career trajectory regardless of whether it is inside or outside The
Carpentries. In particular she wanted me to think about what I will be doing in
The Carpentries after The Workbench is released. Maintenance work is still
necessary and mission-critical, but it's not as encompassing as designing,
testing, and deploying a brand new infrastructure from the ground up. How can I
leverage the challenges faced with the Curriculum and Infrastructure teams to
help bolster my own career growth? Importantly: How can I help Kari advocate for
my growth as both my supervisor and as the Executive Director?

[^2]: Never let anyone tell you they did anything by themselves. That is so rare
    it is effectively a myth. In my case, Alex Hill and Rich FitzJohn reviewed
    and made suggestions to my cover letters and resumes so that they would be
    up-to-snuff for industry positions. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere without
    my references, Sydney Everhart, Annick Lenglet, and Rich FitzJohn to confirm
    that yes, I actually had the potential to work well and grow in this 
    position. All of these people and more helped me to even consider applying
    outside of academia. If you are reading this and are wondering what a
    successful resume and cover letter looks like (and are aware of the 
    implications of survivorship bias), then you can compare the [job
    posting](https://carpentries.org/lesson-infrastructure-technology-developer/)
    against [my 2019 cover
    letter](https://github.com/zkamvar/CV/blob/Carpentries-2019/ZNK_COVER.pdf)
    and [my 2019 
    resume](https://github.com/zkamvar/CV/blob/Carpentries-2019/ZNK_RESUME.pdf).

<!--
Project about to be released How do I see my role expanding or moving forward.
Role critical to mission.
Way our curriculum is expanding, we need developer to
focus on lesson infrastructure.
Should have more time to think about future
ideas. Think about job: what have you done and accomplished. Erin will do review
of JD to make sure they still make sense. Think about where you see your future
with The Carpentries.
Kari does not anticipate that everyone will work for The
Carpentries forever Think about growth; run project? Grant writing? Anything
else that can help build CV. Think about challenges with Infrastructure and
Curriculum team in light of personal skills and interests. 
Once we release The
Workbench, what's next
Write these ideas in a way that Kari can advocate
