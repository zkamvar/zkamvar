![Meme that says "Friendship ended with Academic, now Apéro is my best friend"](featured.jpg)

I've had this blog for several years, going from Jekyll (via beautiful jekyll)
to Hugo (via blogdown and the now-defunct academic theme) and I have once again
decided to switch up formats, which means that some of the old links will no
longer work (e.g. you no longer have to know the exact date I posted a blog in
order to find it).

Whooo wee I have not updated this site since right before the beginning of the pandemic, 
as I was ending my position at Imperial College London and setting off for
new adventures in what would end up being my position at The Carpentries right
as the pandemic started. 

Lets make a rundown of what happened in that time:

1. I got a [new jeorb at The Carpentries!](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/03/lesson-infrastructure-technology-developer/)
2. :house: London, UK :airplane: Portland, OR, USA :house:
3. [Presented at UseR! 2021](/talk/carpentries-user-2021)
4. A whole bunch of blog posts that I _could have written_ about GitHub Actions,
  XPath, systems thinking, mushroom gathering, etc.

I've started this new format because I was frustrated by the old theme and Hugo
always screaming at me that some variables were out-of-date. The recent updates
to blogdown and the new Apéro theme will hopefully make it so I can blog and 
update things more often! And hopefully, I'll get a chance to blog about things
that are _not just_ R stuff. 

As an apology for my lack of blogging, here is an picture of cherry trees 
overlooking a reservoir on Mt. Tabor—an extinct volcano in East Portland, just
a short walk from my apartment.
