I am the Lesson Infrastructure Developer at [The
Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) working to make the Lesson
Infrastructure a more accessible and friendly place to contribute. Iâ€™m trained
in the [population genetics of clonal plant
pathogens](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/poppr/) and have a strong passion for
creating user-friendly and sensible computational tools in R.

This site serves as my personal site where I can blog about various subjects
including R programming, reproducible science, and population genetics.
